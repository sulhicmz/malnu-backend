Subject: [PATCH] security: Remove admin merge bypass from on-pull.yml workflow

Remove the critical security vulnerability where the workflow instructed
the use of --admin flag to bypass branch protection rules. This ensures
all merges respect branch protection and require human review.

Fixes #629
