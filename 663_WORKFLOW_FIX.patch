-              - Build passes

-              Use `gh pr merge --admin` to bypass branch protection when conditions are met.

+               The agent SHOULD prepare PRs for human review but MUST NOT merge.
+
+               PR is READY for human review when:
+               - No conflicts
+               - Build passes
+               - All checks green (except 'on-pull' check which is this workflow)
+               - All PR comments resolved
+               - No security-sensitive change without review
+               - Code follows project style guidelines
+
+               SECURITY: Do NOT use --admin flag or any merge bypass mechanism.
+               Branch protection rules MUST be enforced - all merges require human approval.
+
+           4. After PR is prepared:
+               - Comment with status summary
+               - Label appropriately (ready for review, needs changes, etc.)
+               - Do NOT merge - leave for human review
