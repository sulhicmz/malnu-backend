services:
  # Service for the Hyperf application
  app:
    # Use the official Hyperf image with a specific PHP and Swoole version
    # Choose the image tag that matches your PHP version (e.g., 8.3) and desired Swoole version
    # The alpine variant is generally smaller and recommended for production
    image: hyperf/hyperf:8.3-alpine-v3.19-swoole-v6
    # Use the hyperf/hyperf:8.3-alpine-v3.19-swoole-v6 image as suggested in the documentation.
    # Ensure this matches your PHP version and Swoole requirements.

    # Map the current directory (your Hyperf project root) to the project directory in the container
    # This allows you to edit code on your host machine and have it reflected in the container
    volumes:
      - .:/data/project
      # If you are on a system with SELinux enabled and encounter permission issues,
      # you might need to add `:Z` or `:z` to the volume mount, e.g., `.:/data/project:Z`
      # Or add the `--privileged -u root` flags as mentioned in the documentation,
      # though using volumes with proper permissions is generally preferred.

    # Expose the port Hyperf listens on (default is 9501)
    ports:
      - "9501:9501"
      # Map host port 9501 to container port 9501

    # Set the working directory inside the container
    working_dir: /data/project

    # Command to run when the container starts
    # This starts the Hyperf development server with hot-reloading enabled
    # For production, you might use `php artisan start` or a different command
    command: sh -c "composer install && php artisan watch"
    # `composer install` ensures dependencies are installed inside the container
    # `php artisan watch` starts the server with hot-reload for development

    # Environment variables (optional, can be read from .env file automatically by Hyperf)
    # You can explicitly set variables here if needed, but relying on the .env file is standard.
    # env_file:
    #   - .env
