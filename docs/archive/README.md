# Archived Documentation

This directory contains versioned and outdated documentation files that have been archived from the main `docs/` directory to reduce confusion and improve maintainability.

## What's Archived

### Orchestrator Analysis Reports

The following versioned Orchestrator analysis reports have been superseded by newer versions:

- `ORCHESTRATOR_ANALYSIS_REPORT_v7.md` through `ORCHESTRATOR_ANALYSIS_REPORT_v11.md` - Historical analysis reports
- **Current version**: `ORCHESTRATOR_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` (in main docs/ directory)

### Orchestrator Action Plans

- `ORCHESTRATOR_ACTION_PLAN_v11.md` - Historical action plan

- `ORCHESTRATOR_v11_SUMMARY.md` - Historical summary
- `ORCHESTRATOR_v12_SUMMARY.md` - Historical summary
- **Current version**: `ORCHESTRATOR_SUMMARY.md` (in main docs/ directory)

### GitHub Projects Setup

The following versioned GitHub Projects setup guides have been archived:

- `GITHUB_PROJECTS_SETUP_v2.md` through `GITHUB_PROJECTS_SETUP_v4.md` - Versioned setup guides
- `GITHUB_PROJECTS_SETUP_GUIDE_v2.md` - Versioned guide

### Duplicate Issues Consolidation Plans

- `DUPLICATE_ISSUES_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN_v2.md` - Historical consolidation plan
- **Current approach**: See current issues and PRs in repository

## Why These Were Archived

These files were versioned during the Orchestrator analysis and repository consolidation efforts. Keeping them in the main `docs/` directory created:

- Confusion about which version was authoritative
- Difficulty finding current documentation
- Maintenance burden with multiple copies

## Accessing Archived Files

All archived files are preserved in this directory for reference if needed. Git history also contains all previous versions.

## Current Documentation

For current, authoritative documentation, see the main `docs/` directory:

- **Developer Guide**: `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`
- **API Documentation**: `API.md`
- **Architecture**: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Database Schema**: `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`
- **Contributing**: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **Application Status**: `APPLICATION_STATUS.md`
- And more...

See `docs/INDEX.md` for a complete index of all documentation.
