Workflow files created but cannot be added to PR due to GitHub security restrictions.

See issue #134 for complete CI/CD implementation:
- ci.yml: Automated testing (PHPUnit 8.2/8.3), PHPStan analysis, PHP CS Fixer checks
- security.yml: Security scanning (Composer audit, Dependency Review, CodeQL analysis)
- deploy.yml: Deployment automation with pre-deployment checks

These files need to be added manually by maintainers to .github/workflows/
