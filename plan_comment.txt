Issue #136: CRITICAL: Fix HyperVel framework import errors and type definitions

After analyzing the codebase, I found the following:

## Current State Analysis:
1. **Application foundation**: Uses  in bootstrap/app.php - CORRECT
2. **Models**: Base Model.php was changed to use  - APPEARS CORRECT 
3. **Config files**: Use  consistently - CORRECT
4. **Migrations**: Mixed pattern - some use Hyperf classes with Hypervel facades
5. **Seeders**: Use  - APPEARS CORRECT

## Issue Analysis:
The main inconsistency is in the migration files where there's a mixed pattern:
- Core classes (Migration, Blueprint, DbConnection):  
- Facades: 

## Plan:
1. Keep models using  (already consistent)
2. Keep config files using  (already correct)
3. Keep application foundation using  (already correct)
4. For migrations: Standardize on the working mixed pattern
5. For seeders: Keep using 

The issue description says to fix 'Incorrect Import Paths: Using Hypervel\ instead of Hyperf\ for many classes', but based on my testing, changing database migration classes causes errors, suggesting the Hypervel framework provides its own database classes.
