I'm working on implementing the consolidated CI/CD pipeline as requested in issue #134. Here's my plan:

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Consolidation Plan

### Current Issues Identified:
- 7 redundant OpenCode workflows causing complexity
- No automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Missing quality gates (tests, linting, security scans)
- No code coverage reporting
- Complex OpenCode integration

### Solution Approach:
1. **Consolidate Workflows**: Reduce from 7 to 3 essential workflows
   - `ci.yml` - Testing and quality checks
   - `security.yml` - Security scanning and dependency checks
   - `deploy.yml` - Deployment automation

2. **Add Essential Quality Gates**:
   - Automated PHPUnit testing
   - Code coverage reporting
   - PHPStan static analysis
   - PHP CS Fixer code style checks
   - Security scanning

3. **Improve Test Configuration**:
   - Configure proper test database
   - Add coverage reporting
   - Set up test parallelization

### Implementation Status:
✅ Analyzed current workflows and identified redundant ones
✅ Created consolidated CI workflow with automated testing
✅ Created security scanning workflow
✅ Created deployment workflow
✅ Added code coverage reporting configuration
✅ Updated documentation to reflect new CI/CD setup
✅ Added deprecation notices to old workflows

This implementation addresses the critical infrastructure issue by providing a streamlined, secure, and efficient CI/CD pipeline with proper quality gates.
