# 🏚️ DEPRECATED APPLICATION NOTICE

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DEPRECATION WARNING ⚠️

This entire directory (`web-sch-12/`) contains a **DEPRECATED** application that is **NO LONGER MAINTAINED** and should **NOT BE USED** for any development activities.

---

## Current Status
- **Status**: ❌ **DEPRECATED & DISCONTINUED**
- **Maintenance**: ❌ **NO LONGER MAINTAINED**
- **Development**: ❌ **DO NOT DEVELOP HERE**
- **Support**: ❌ **NO SUPPORT PROVIDED**

---

## Migration Required

**ALL DEVELOPMENT MUST NOW OCCUR IN:**
- **Primary Application**: Root directory of this repository (`/`)
- **Framework**: HyperVel (Laravel-style with Swoole support)
- **Status**: ✅ **ACTIVE & MAINTAINED**

---

## Why is this deprecated?

1. **Performance**: The main application uses HyperVel with Swoole for superior performance
2. **Features**: The main application has a more comprehensive feature set
3. **Activity**: All active development happens in the main application
4. **Architecture**: Modern coroutine-based architecture in the main application

---

## What you should do

### For New Development:
```bash
# Work in the main application (root directory)
cd /path/to/malnu-backend/  # NOT in web-sch-12/
```

### For Existing Work:
- Migrate any work to the main application in the root directory
- Update your development environment to focus on the main application
- Refer to the main README.md in the root directory for current development guidelines

---

## Migration Guide

### To access the correct application:
1. Navigate to the repository root: `cd /path/to/malnu-backend/`
2. All development should happen in the main directory, NOT in `web-sch-12/`
3. The main application uses HyperVel framework (Laravel-style with Swoole support)

### Key differences:
- **Main App**: HyperVel framework with Swoole support (high performance)
- **This App**: Laravel 12 with modular architecture (deprecated)

## Timeline
